//! Shared types for multi-frontend example.
//!
//! Note: App state types are defined in each frontend crate to satisfy
//! Rust's orphan rules (they need to implement eframe::App locally).

// This crate exists for sharing types between frontends if needed.
// Currently each frontend defines its own app state type.
