Always ensure we're committing clean code with cargo fmt, cargo check, and cargo clippy -- -D warnings. If modifying any behavior, always ensure we're still passing tests with cargo test.

When adding new dependencies, we almost always want to use the latest version. We should use `cargo add` to simply add the latest version or otherwise figure out the latest version and update to it.

If you're running into issues with APIs from having changed from what you remember, consider cloning the repo (not into our repo, we don't want to make it a submodule) and literally reading the code and/or docs.
